The modifications made were adding a delimiter variable to store the delimiter to be used. If the input has a / at the start
it means a different delimiter will be used so it is parsed in from the numbers string. The delimiter is set to , by default.
All the \n characters are replaced with the new delimiter. The Pattern.quote is included as to allow for all kinds of delimiters
even reserved regex characters like (. An exception is thrown if the number is negative and ignored (converted to 0) if
the number is over 1000.
